        <h4 class="text-center pb-4 mb-4 text-zinc-500 border-b-2">-How to sell your home for top dollar.</h4>
        <p class="pb-6 leading-7 text-gray-500 text-center text-2xl ">5 factors that contribute to the success of your home sale, and for top dollar.</p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl pb-4">1. Location</h2>
        <p class="pb-6 leading-7">This factor is set in stone from the moment you purchased it. These are also the three rules of real estate. Location, Location, Location. There are several advantages if you are very aware of the risk you are taking when you purchase. See Buyer's guide to mitigating risk.</p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl pb-4">2. Condition</h2>
        <p class="pb-6 leading-7">This factory is completely up to you, the homeowner. The less unfinished projects on the property, and the cleaner the home is the more money it will sell for. There are some exceptions to these recommendations for example: If the lot is 100% of the property's value.</p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl pb-4">3. Price</h2>
        <p class="pb-6 leading-7">In a Seller's market it's not as important to have a perfect price, but in a buyer's market you can harm your bottom line by pricing the home too high right out the gate. Many people say "What's the harm in trying for more?", but there is a risk. When days on market begin to climb, you've entered into stagnant listing territory, and the only way to get out is to reduce the price. The home's value is exactly equivalent to what a single buyer is willing to pay for it... Nothing else. A property appraisal and the city's tax assessment are all just predictions of what someone might be willing to pay for the home.</p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl pb-4">4. Marketing</h2>
        <p class="pb-6 leading-7">This factor sits entirely on you and your agent's marketing strategy. For your marketing, you need appropriate photos of a clean, finished, and presentable home, virtual tour, RMS measurements, and a write up that highlights the home advantages not obvious from looking at the photos. Here in Canada, the overwhelming majority of the available homes for sale (with the exception of new) are available to view on Realtor.ca. If your home is showcased appropriately on realtor.ca there is no greater level of market exposure. Your home is viewable across the globe on thousands of different web tools. As long as everyone is answering their phone and easy to reach, this box is checked.</p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl pb-4">5. Luck</h2>
        <p class="pb-6 leading-7 border-b-2">Regrettable, luck plays a small factor. Sometimes you just get lucky. You should focus on the things you can control to reduce the need for luck in landing a successful sale.</p>
