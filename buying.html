        <h1 class="text-center text-4xl mt-12">Home Buyer's Guide</h1>
        <h4 class="text-center pb-4 mb-4 text-gray-500 border-b-2">-What you can expect as a home buyer</h4>
        <h2 class="text-2xl pb-4">1. Determine your budget</h2>
        <p class="pb-6 leading-7">Before you start looking at homes, it's important to have a clear idea of how much you can afford to spend and to have a pre-approval letter from your broker. This will give you a sense of your price range and will make you a more attractive buyer when you make an offer on a home.</p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl pb-4">2. Shopping!</h2>
        <p class="pb-6 leading-7">Once you have your budget and pre-approval in place, you can start researching neighborhoods and looking at homes that are on the market. This can include browsing listings online, visiting open houses, and working with a real estate agent to find properties that match your criteria.</p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl pb-4">3. The offer</h2>
        <p class="pb-6 leading-7">Once you find a home that you want to buy, you will make an offer to the seller. The seller may counter your offer, and you will then negotiate the terms of the purchase.</p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl pb-4">4. Secure your financing</h2>
        <p class="pb-6 leading-7">If your offer is accepted, you will need to secure financing for your purchase. This typically involves working with your broker to complete the approval and providing all of the necessary documentation. This happens even if you are pre-approved. 
        </p class="pb-6 leading-7">
        <h2 class="text-2xl pb-4">5. Home Inspection</h2>
        <p class="pb-6 leading-7">Once you have secured financing and have a sales contract, the next step is to have the home inspected to ensure that there are no major issues with the property.
        </p class="pb-6 leading-7">
        <h2 class="text-2xl pb-4">6. Close on the purchase</h2>
        <p class="pb-6 leading-7">After the inspection, you will finalize the purchase by signing the condition waiver. From this moment on, there is no backing out. Between condition waiver and possession, the lawyer of your choosing will reach out and book a time to sign all the legal docs.</p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl pb-4">7. Possession!</h2>
        <p class="pb-6 leading-7 border-b-2">After the deal goes firm, you will take possession of the property and can move into your new home. Don't forget to hook up the utilities!</p>
